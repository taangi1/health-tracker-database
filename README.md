# Database for wearable health tracker systems

The project creates a robust database for wearable health tracker systems, such as smart watches. It effectively captures all the necessary metrics and information needed to analyse the health and physical activity of a person wearing the device.

## Data generation

The project created a robust pipeline for generating fiscal data that makes sense with help of python library faker and sqlite integration for python. It effectively captures all the scenarios and accounts for different wearing conditions.
